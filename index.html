        <h1 id="head">About Me</h1>
        <div class="pagetwo-one">
            <h2>1. Professional journey</h2>
            <p>I began my career with a strong academic foundation, completing my BCA (2019–2021) followed by an MCA (2021–2023). While
pursuing my studies, I also started working as a .NET Developer (Jan 2021 – May 2022), gaining practical industry experience early on.
Driven by a passion for modern web technologies, I transitioned to the MERN Stack, where I worked on various live projects from
June 2022 to Jan 2024.
In January 2024, I took a bold step and founded my own IT and Digital Marketing company, Inforag Technology, focused on delivering
innovative tech solutions. Soon after, in February 2025, I co-founded E-Skills Web, an institute dedicated to professional training in IT
and Digital Marketing, helping students and freshers build real-world skills.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pagetwo-two">
            <h2>2. Founding story</h2>
            <p>During my early professional journey, I realized a significant gap between what students were taught in classrooms and the real skills
required in the tech industry. While working as a .NET Developer and later on the MERN Stack, I interacted with many freshers and
interns who had potential—but lacked proper guidance, mentorship, and hands-on experience.
This sparked the idea to build something meaningful.
In January 2024, I founded Inforag Technology with a vision to offer not just IT solutions to businesses, but also to create an
environment where learning and execution go hand-in-hand. I wanted to blend service with skill-building—where clients get results,
and young talents get real work exposure.
Later, in February 2025, I co-founded E-Skills Web with the aim to bridge the education-to-employment gap. Our goal is simple:
empower students with practical knowledge, real project experience, and industry-relevant training in fields like full-stack
development, digital marketing, and more.</p>

        <h2 id="headfour">Vision</h2>
    <p id="para-four">My vision is to build a powerful ecosystem where technology, innovation, and practical education work handin-

Through Inforag Technology, I aim to provide cutting-edge digital solutions that not only solve technical
problems but also support long-term business growth. From startups to established brands, our goal is to
deliver services that are efficient, scalable, and future-ready—whether it's web development, digital

and Digital Marketing. Our vision is to fill the gap between traditional classroom education and real industry
needs. We focus on skill-based, job-oriented training, live projects, and mentorship that prepares learners not

In the long run, I envision creating a network of talent and technology that supports each other. Businesses
get the results they need; students get the career guidance they deserve.</p>

<div class="pagefour-second">
<h2 id="headfour">4. Leadership Style</h2>
<p id="para-four">I follow a leadership style that combines strategic vision with active collaboration. I believe in empowering
individuals by giving them the space to think, create, and take ownership of their work. Rather than
micromanaging, I focus on mentorship, skill development, and accountability—ensuring that everyone on the
team grows alongside the company.
Clear communication, trust, and continuous learning are at the core of how I lead. I aim to create an
environment where people feel confident to share ideas, solve problems independently, and stay aligned with a
shared mission.</p>
